ShaderMan.Next is new code, and some of it's parts are just not implemented or use simple stubs.
Thus, the following list of limitations:

  * OpenGL 2 support is required, specifically, non-power-of-two textures support. If your drivers doesn't support that, let me know.
    I'm considering downgrading the code from OpenGL2 to OpenGL1.2 and ARB extension for NPOT textures. But it works for my Linux and Mac
    boxes and on couple of Windows machines my co-workers have around.
  * Generated output files are always named using test123.* pattern - this name is hardcoded for now.
  * Unix mode is hardly functional except the example scene file - it's just here to show the possibilities of the tool
    besides the usual code generation.
  * Source code isn't really documented, however some important and tricky parts are.
  * Node display font and colors are partially hardcoded
  * Node zoom isn't implemented
  * Auto-update of preview doesn't work when editing the parameters of node. Hovewer it works OK when you connect/disconnect nodes.
  * Source code doesn't really adhere to PEP8 standards - I've mostly used the wxPython naming conventions and 8-spaces-tabulation.
