Hello, and welcome to ShaderMan.Next.

------------------------------------------------

This is an early preliminary release. It's working, most of the basis functionality
is available and tested. However, it doesn't have all the functionality planned.

The code is developed on Fedora Core 5 Linux and Mac OS X 10.4.9 and tested (by other people) on Windows XP SP2.

See INSTALL for installation instructions, and LIMITATIONS for, er, limitations :) Obviously, LICENSE contains the license.

To run, switch to the ShaderMan.Next directory, then run prototype.py either by double-clicking
on it (if you're on Windows) or by running "python prototype.py" in terminal on Linux and Mac OS X. 

On Mac OS X, if you're using Python 2.3 (or, if you never bothered to upgrade Python or
don't know how to do it), the proper command would be "pythonw prototype.py". Note pythonw is
obsolete as of Python 2.4.

Please send patches, new modes, bugs, wishes, requests for SVN access and any types of comments to me.
